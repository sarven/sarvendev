I am Staff Software Engineer from Poland with more than 10 years of experience, combining a pragmatic approach with 
a passion for solving complex problems, always tailoring solutions to meet business needs. My work is guided by a strong focus on TDD, DDD, architecture, scalability, and performance. Software engineering isn’t just my profession - it’s my main interest, and I’m constantly striving to learn and improve. This blog is my space to share insights, practical knowledge, and experiences from the world of engineering.
